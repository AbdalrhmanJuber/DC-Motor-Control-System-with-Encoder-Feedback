# DC-Motor-Control-System-with-Encoder-Feedback
This Arduino-based project demonstrates a DC motor control system using an L293D motor driver, a potentiometer, and an incremental encoder for feedback. The system is designed to adjust the motor's speed and direction dynamically based on the potentiometer input and display real-time feedback on an LCD screen.
